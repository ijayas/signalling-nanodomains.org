We work with a wide range of outstanding groups from around the world, and we're always on the lookout for new and unique perspectives.
We want to push the frontier of single molecule science and train the next generation of biomedical researchers. The diversity and inclusion in our group allows us to thrive and excel. Our day-to-day business is guided by the group's [code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EzL6b2nSncjnNgZZ5FO668exTe6PWi4FZ4H7hF4WuE/edit?usp=sharing), a document co-developed my lab members, past and present, to help align ourselves on our common goals and values in the workplace.
