I completed my Masters in Biological Sciences at the University of Sheffield (2019-2020), wherein I learnt about the variety of microscopes available and their core functionality. Completing the master by building a simulation of a confocal microscope in Python.

This had peaked my interest further into academics hence I pursed a PhD and started my doctoral training under Izzyâ€™s supervision. The PhD, also at the University of Sheffield (2021-present), consists of finding ways to make Expansion Microscopy more robust and reproducible as a technique. In particular, we have developed a plate-based approach to the process (Geometry-preserving Expansion Microscopy), alongside computational tools to assist in distortion analysis of pre-post expansion images. I am also doing work with 3D printing, robotics and electronics to reach this goal.

Alongside my PhD, I am keenly interested in open microscopy and the related biological applications and advancements. Otherwise, outside the lab, I have interests in gaming, gundam and gadgets.
