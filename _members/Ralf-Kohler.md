Motivated and dedicated multiplexed imaging specialist with a strong focus on analytical equipment maintenance and image data analysis, where the hardware-based conversion of real value measurements into extracted and functionally related model data analyses has accompanied me since my studies of Applied Physics and Medical Engineering at the "Berliner Hochschule für Technik" (B. Eng. / M. Eng., 2010-2016). As a team player who has worked in international environments, I am passionate about research, science, development and education. My technical and analytical skills in scientific project design, consulting and training students in data analysis or microscopy have resulted in high impact publications during my time at the “German Rheumatism Research Centre” in Berlin. There I worked as a microscope operator (2016-2023) and in parallel completed my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the "Freie Universität Berlin" (2020-2023), performing image analysis at the protein and transcriptional level in tissues. After moving to the tropics in Australia (Cairns region, 2023), I continued my research at the "University of New South Wales" (2024-present), developing an AI tool to help identify better treatments for failing hearts.
