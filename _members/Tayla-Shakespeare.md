I studied for my undergraduate degree at the University of Sheffield, graduating in 2017 with an MSci in Biochemistry. During my master’s project, I developed a tracking algorithm which sparked my passion for image analysis and computer programming. I spent the next two years working in London as a trade support analyst, using my computer programming skills to solve problems with trading algorithms. In 2020, I moved back into biomedical research, working on the development of COVID-19 test kits at a small start-up company.

I started my PhD at the University of Sheffield in September 2021. My project focuses on the development and implementation of Expansion Microscopy (a new super-resolution imaging tool) to investigate cellular processes. This research brings together my love of biochemistry and image analysis to resolve important questions in biomedical research. 

I spend my free time running through the Sheffield peaks or hiking up the tougher hills. I love spending time with my cats, and in my garden where I grow my own vegetables and wildflowers, or simply sit back and enjoy the infamous Sheffield views!
