I started my studies in the Netherlands, at the University of Maastricht in 2015. I developed a strong interest in molecular biology and toxicology during this time. For my research, I joined the Toxicogenomics lab to investigate the impact of mTOR on cellular responses to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In 2020, my passion for toxicology led me to my M.Sc. in Molecular Toxicology at the University of Birmingham and my research in the Cancer and Genomics lab. The highlight of my research involved using single-molecule DNA fiber analysis with confocal microscopy to observe and analyze replication fork speed and dynamics.

I began my PhD at the University of Sheffield in October 2023. My project is on the role of site-specific phosphorylation in AAA+ ATPases. I am investigating the structural, biochemical and functional consequences of phosphomimetic mutations. Expansion Microscopy (ExM) will be used to investigate the dynamics and spatial localization of these mutants.

Outside of the PhD I love to spend time listening to music or podcasts while cooking or working out.  I also enjoy gardening and will make time to visit my grandparents and help in the greenhouse.
