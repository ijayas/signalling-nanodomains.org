Interested and motivated in cardiovascular disease and cardiac physiology, I achieved my bachelor’s degree in clinical medicine from Shenzhen University, China (2016-2021). Following that, I completed my master’s degree (2021-2024) from South China University of Technology. During that time, I conducted research at the Guangdong Cardiovascular Institution (Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital) primarily focusing on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. I am familiar with clinical arrhythmias, animal electrophysiologic experiments and cardiac remodelling. I am also passionate about research, science, and new technologies. As a member of an active research team led by Prof. Yumei Xue, some of my research results have been published in journals like "Europace", "EHJ-case report", and conference abstracts in HRS and APHRS. During my research about ion channels and cardiac remodelling in pathological conditions, I developed a strong interest in imaging and analysing changes in the structures, localizations and interactions of ion channels and regulatory proteins in healthy and diseased hearts. Now, I am joining in Izzy Jayasinghe’s lab (2025-present) to start my PhD research on Expansion Microscopy and structures of sub-cellular nanodomains.
