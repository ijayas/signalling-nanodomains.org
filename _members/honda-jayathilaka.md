Between 2018 and 2022, I completed my doctoral studies at the University of New South Wales. During this time, my research focused on the dynamic cellular responses within soft hydrogel materials. I aimed to understand the complex mechanisms by which cells sense and adapt to mechanical cues. Throughout my doctoral studies, I received training in human stem cell culture techniques and designing soft materials. I also worked on developing force-responsive hydrogel materials for tissue engineering applications.
In 2023, I worked as a Technical Officer at the Electron Microscopy Unit, where I gained more knowledge about microscopy techniques, particularly for biology.
Prior to that, I obtained my Master's degree in Designing Biomaterials for Drug Delivery from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2017 and an Honors degree in Materials Science. This provided me with a strong foundation in understanding both biology and chemistry. During this period of my studies, I started to learn about biochemistry, microscopy, instrumentation, spectroscopy, molecular biology, and materials chemistry.
Outside of my studies and work, I enjoy exploring new places, practicing meditation, and creating art.
