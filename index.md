We are a team of biomedical and biophysical scientists based in UNSW Sydney and Sheffield University who harness the latest single molecule, optical, and omic technologies to study cell signalling. Our goal is to use our expertise in how signals are transdueced, particularly inside cells, to shed light on the mechanisms driving pathophysiologies such as heart disease, movement disorders, and pain. Concurrently, we work on developing new methodologies that both we and our scientific community can utilise for advancing our understanding of disease and help drive the development of theraputic strategies.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Most of the primary functions of the body can be traced down to the spatial organisation and interactions of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids in cells of the heart, central and periopheral nervous system, and tumours. We study signalling proteins in their spatial organisation, chemical configuration, and their communication with partnering molecules in situ. Studying these features of individual and groups proteins in their native environment gives us a unique window into the fundamental rules of life, health, and disease. To visualise these biomolecules with the highest precision we leverage optical super-resolution microscopy techniques such as localisation microscopy and expansion microscopy.

We currently work on a number of research and technology questions. What are the networks of molecules that regulate the calcium signals that drive the heartbeat? What is the 3D organisation of molecules in signalling domains on the surfaces of neurons? What are the components of the molecular machinery that regulate the shape and sizes of membrane-bound organelles and vesicles in tumour cells? We also work on developing new biomedical research tools. These include new, hydrogel-based expansion microscopy protocols that allow us to physically inflate cells, AI-based tools to recognise patterns in our image data, bespoke microscopes and 3D printed robots. So, whether you are a life or biomedical scientist, or more interested in the physics, engineering or the tech, we will have projects that will interest to you.
